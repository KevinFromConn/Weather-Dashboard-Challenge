# Weather Dashboard

When fully functional, this app will serve as a weather dashboard, where users can search for weather in any given city, and be shown not only the weather at the moment, but a detailed five-day forecast. In its current state, the app will freeze upon attempting to search, and due to time restrictions I was not able to reach full functionality. I intend to return to this challenge as soon as I am able, to attempt to reach full functionality.
